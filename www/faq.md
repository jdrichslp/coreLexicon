### Scoring Facts and Questions

Q. If a person says a CoreLex item more than once, do they receive multiple points?

- A. No, lemmas as scored as either 1 or 0 regardless of the number of times they are produced during the discourse.

Q. The CoreLex checklist includes the word “run”. Does a person have to say “run” in order to receive credit?

- A. No, lemmas include all inflected forms of a word (e.g., run, running, ran)

Q. My participant said “got dressed” during their Cinderella story re-tell. Should this receive credit for “dress”

- A. Yes. Even though “dress” is most commonly used as a noun in the Cinderella story, part of speech does not affect scoring, so this individual should have “dress” scored as a 1.

Q. My participant said “Cinderella sprinted down the stairs”. Sould this receive credit for “run”?

- A. No. Lemmas should not be scored as present if a synonym is produced.

Q. My participant produced a phonological paraphasia of a CoreLex lemma. Should they receive credit for this?

- A. Maybe. If the CoreLex lemma is clear from context and would be understood by the average listener as being a production of the lemma, it can be counted as a production of the CoreLex lemma.

Q. My participant produced a semantic paraphasia of a CoreLex lemma. Should they receive credit for this?

- A. No. Semantic paraphasias should not be scored for the target CoreLex lemma. However, if the actual semantic paraphasia production is also a CoreLex lemma, they could receive credit for that item. For example, in the Cinderella story, both “mother” and “father” are CoreLex items. If a participant said “the father and her two daughters were mean to Cinderella” they could receive credit for producing the CoreLex lemma “father”, even though it is fairly clear that this was a semantic paraphasia of the target “mother”.
