### About the app

The core lexicon web-app is intended to facilitate efficient and accurate scoring of core lexicon for both research and clinical practice. The app is currently in Beta, and is not yet ready for research or clinical deployment. 

This app is built using the {shiny} R framework, along with a number of other packages and their dependencies: config, golem, bslib, dplyr, ggplot2, googleshets4, here, shinyjs, shinyWidgets, stringr, tidyr, waiter, scales, magrittr, pkgload, markdown, tibble, readr, DT, knitr, kableExtra, and cowplot. The app is open source; the source code is located at https://github.com/aphasia-apps/mainConcept. Comments, feedback, and bug-reports are best made on the [github issues page](https://github.com/aphasia-apps/mainConcept/issues) (github.com accounts are free) but can also be emailed to Rob Cavanaugh (see link below). Contributions via pull requests are welcome. 

Please note, <u>***the app does not save any data from each user session***</u> for privacy reasons (<a href="https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/Storage.html" target="_blank">See here</a>). However, this also means that refreshing the page or a lost internet connection will lose any current data. 

 
### About us

[**Robert Cavanaugh, M.S., CCC-SLP**](https://robcavanaugh.com) is a speech-language pathologist and Ph.D candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. His research focuses on identifying and resolving implementation gaps in aphasia rehabilitation, improving patient access to evidence-based care, and enhancing treatment specification and effectiveness. He is also interested in statistics and data science, programming (R + python + js), data visualization, and science communication in communication sciences and disorders.

[**Dr. Jessica Richardson, Ph.D., CCC-SLP**](https://shs.unm.edu/people/faculty/jessica-richardson.html) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, NM. She is also affiliated with the UNM Center for Brain Recovery and Repair, where she also serves as Outreach Director. Her adult-focused research focuses on brain recovery and repair, treatment efficacy, and development of much-needed outcome measures that better predict increased functional outcomes and life participation. This involves development and application of novel treatment approaches and adjuncts for persons with brain injury or disease, including group approaches, telehealth, noninvasive brain stimulation, and care partner training. 


[**Dr. Sarah Grace Dalton, Ph.D., CCC-SLP**](https://www.marquette.edu/speech-pathology-audiology/directory/sarah-grace-dalton.php) is an Assistant Professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI. Her research includes an emphasis on creating efficient, meaningful, clinically applicable tools to measure discourse production in adults with neurogenic language disorders. Her goal is to provide tools that will allow clinicians and researchers to measure communication behaviors that are of greatest interest to clients and participants, and ensure that treatment goals reflect the desires of individuals living with neurogenic communication impairments.
