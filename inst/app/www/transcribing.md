- Include words/phrases even if they are repeated or part of revisions 
- Include the standard version of nonstandard productions (e.g., “outta” -> “out of”; “gonna” -> “going to”)
- Include words with non-typical sounds (e.g., slurred, distorted) and type as the target word as long as it is recognizable/intelligible 
- Include words with sound errors (substitutions, omissions, phonological errors, etc.) as long as the target is recognizable/intelligible with context and approximately 50% of phonemes are correct (as shorter words or words with odd numbers of phonemes may have <50% of phonemes correct but still be intelligible). Use your best clinical judgement to determine intelligibility within context. 
- Exclude part-words, false starts, sounds/syllables produced as a participant attempts to say a word
- Exclude neologisms (less than 50% of phonemes correct). (See also rule #4.)
- Exclude fillers – meaningless non-words such as “uh”, “um”, “er”. (Some real words may serve a filler function [e.g., to stall while thinking of what to say; “you know”, “like”, “so”, “okay”], but for the sake of reliability, leave them in the transcript.) 
- Exclude information/words/phrases/sentences spoken by the clinician or assessor. You are only focusing on the participant
- Exclude utterances prompted by the clinician.
